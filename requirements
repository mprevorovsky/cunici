A web application for math practice for elementary school kids.
Should support multiple users (user name displayed on the app screen).
Provides a range of exercise types (as plugins?), users can set which types they want to currently utilize (checkboxes?).
The user is presented with a series of *random* calculations (random numbers, conforming to the selected exercise types) and must solve them.
The size of the series can be user defined.
If incorrect solution is provided by the user, the user is given 1 chance to correct. (optional feature? boolean...) 
User should get specific feedback on passed/failed calculations, including correct solutions.
User receives 1 heart for each correct solution and one pig for each incorrect one.
Score (hearts/pigs) is kept for each series of calculations, for each session, and grand total for all sessions (persistent database).
The current score for the series/session(/grand total) is displayed on the app screen.



MAYBE...
Could play sounds for each in/correct solution
Time could be tracked for each calculation, session, grand total -> time-limited solving (simulate test at school); stats to identify most problematic exercise types?
Various achievements could be unlocked to gamify the application (straight hearts 1,2,3... series, etc.
Could track dates/time of usage to get usage stats
Users could select their own characters (sounds) for in/correct answers (from enums?)
